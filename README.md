 C++ banking system implementation has several features that make it functional and useful for managing customer accounts. Here are the key features:

Account Creation:

The system allows creating new customer accounts with a unique account number and an initial deposit.
Deposit Functionality:

Customers can deposit money into their accounts.
The system updates the account balance accordingly.
Withdrawal Functionality:

Customers can withdraw money from their accounts.
The system checks for sufficient balance before allowing the withdrawal and updates the balance.
Display Account Details:

The system can display the details of any customer account, including the name, account number, and current balance.
Data Storage and Management:

The system uses an unordered_map to store and manage customer accounts efficiently.
Each account is identified by a unique account number.
Encapsulation and Object-Oriented Design:

The system uses classes (Customer and Bank) to encapsulate data and related functionalities.
This design makes the code modular, easier to maintain, and extend.
Possible Extensions and Enhancements:
Transaction History:

Implement a feature to keep track of all transactions (deposits and withdrawals) for each account.
Interest Calculation:

Add functionality to calculate and apply interest to savings accounts periodically.
Account Types:

Introduce different types of accounts (e.g., savings, checking) with specific features and rules.
Error Handling:

Improve error handling to cover more edge cases and provide more informative error messages.
User Authentication:

Implement a basic authentication system to ensure that only authorized users can access and manage accounts.
Persistent Storage:

Save account data to a file or database to persist the data beyond the program's execution.
User Interface:

Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) or a more user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the system.
